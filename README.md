# scales-vst

Wrangle your MIDI data into a variety of scales in creative ways! This project is built with [JUCE](https://juce.com/get-juce).

## Compiling
Open the Sclaes.jucer project file with JUCE's [Projucer](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_new_projucer_project.html) manager. From there you can generate a project template for your IDE of choice. I have tested this on XCode and Visual Studio.
